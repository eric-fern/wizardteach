##Composer Context prompt - our first prompt when attacking a specific problem - Must have a fresh agent and composer. 

Familiarize yourself with the @README.md 

Take a look around our @src 

If you have any questions right now let me know. Today we will be working on our @onboardwizard 

Onboard wizard uses a template from its folder, and takes us through our initial onbaording

Our application entry point is Home.vue where we get our first pinia store value filled out.

Remember our state management is done through pinia and we have an initial local store, but if we manage to get an email, that store becomes a persistent backend DB store. We need this backend store so we can keep track of our teachers schedule, lesson plan, and generated materials.

So right now were just worried about this local store so we can get that initial lesson plan going. from that lesson plan we will build out the rest of our materials. 

Does this make sense. Please ask me any questions you may have about our specific most pressing task which is finishing our onboarding wizard. You may offer advice or recommendations. but offer it one at a time.

Our immediate next step is to finish the local onboarding wizard, then we will finish once we are ready to collect the teacher's email.

Do not code anything until I tell you.
