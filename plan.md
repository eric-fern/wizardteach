Were focusing on selling ai generated digital and printable content for teachers. Its a one time flow that has them spend 50$, then they are set for the year and wont have to buy or create any classroom materiaslEditAh, now I understand better - you're creating a platform focused on AI-generated teaching materials with a one-time annual fee model. Let me break down the key functionalities needed for this specific approach:
Core Generation Features:

Worksheet generator that creates customized practice sheets for any subject and grade level
Lesson plan builder that expands basic topics into full detailed plans
Assessment creator for quizzes, tests, and exit tickets
Visual aids generator for posters, anchor charts, and bulletin board materials
Flashcard and study guide creator for any topic
Game and activity generator for interactive learning materials

Customization Tools:

Grade level adjustment for all generated content
Subject-specific templating (math, language arts, science, social studies)
Difficulty level controls
Options to modify language for ESL/ELL students
Ability to add school/teacher branding
Format selection (digital PDF, Google Docs, printable versions)

Essential Platform Features:

Simple one-time payment processing ($50 annual fee)
Download history to access previously generated materials
Basic editing tools to tweak AI-generated content
Bulk generation capability (create multiple related resources at once)
Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go generation
Quick-start templates for common teaching needs

Would you like me to focus on designing any specific part of this system? I can help create the interface flows, AI prompting system, or specific generation templates for different subjects. CopyRetryEthe idea is to have the teacher use the app once an dbe goodEditAh, I understand - you want a super streamlined, one-and-done solution where teachers pay $50, use the app once to generate everything they need for the year, and they're set. Let me outline what this focused approach would look like:
Core Flow:

Teacher signs up and pays $50
They input:

Grade level they teach
Subject(s) they teach
State/curriculum standards they follow
Basic class info (number of students, special needs accommodations)


The system then auto-generates their complete yearly package:

Full year of lesson plans
All worksheets needed for each unit
All assessments (quizzes, tests, homework)
Classroom decorations and visual aids
Parent communication templates
Answer keys for everything
Digital and printable versions of all materials


Everything downloads as an organized package, ready to use

The key is making this a single, comprehensive generation that gives them literally everything they need for the year in one go. No need to come back and generate more stuff - it's all there, organized and ready.
Would you like me to design the specific user flow for this one-time generation process? I can map out exactly how we'd structure the input form to make it as simple as possible while still getting all the info needed to generate a full year's worth of materials. CopyRetryEthe 50$ will be at the end once theyve added all their info and needs for their class room. give me a bunch of ideas for what to show teachers that has been generated so they can pay and get it emailed to them., We might preview the first and a couple middle weeks of class. What materials should we generate? Give me a list. A good reference is that we are trying to replace a lot of the stuff that would be bought on teaqchers pay teachers.,EditHere's a strategic list of materials to preview to teachers that will demonstrate high value and convince them to purchase the full year package:

Would you like me to focus on designing preview versions of any of these specific materials? We could create compelling samples that showcase the quality while still reserving the bulk of the content for paying customers. CopyRetryEthe materials will change based on age of student, and student type. Give a start list that broadly applies to the most students. We need 4 or 5 really strong categories to put behind pay wall once we gather the tewachers informationEditLet me break this down into the most universally needed categories that would provide immediate, high value across most grade levels and student types. These would be shown as "preview" items first, then the full year's worth would be generated based on their specific inputs after payment.

WEVE DECIDED OUR MAIN 4 VALUE PROPS ARE:

Complete Unit Planners & Daily Lesson Plans
    Full detailed daily lesson plans aligned to standards
    Unit overview documents and pacing guides
    Learning objectives and success criteria
    Differentiation suggestions for various student levels
    Assessment strategies and rubrics
        This is arguably our strongest value prop because lesson planning is extremely time-consuming and every teacher needs it daily.
Assessment & Practice Package
    Weekly quizzes for each subject
    Unit tests with multiple versions
    Homework assignments with answer keys
    Exit tickets/quick checks for understanding
    Practice worksheets with differentiated levels
        Teachers spend countless hours creating and grading assessments - this is a major pain point we can solve.
        
Interactive Learning Materials
    Digital slide decks for each unit
    Student-facing digital activities
    Interactive notebooks/guided notes
    Digital manipulatives and games
    Virtual learning resources
        With the increasing focus on technology in education, having ready-made digital materials is extremely valuable.

Student Engagement & Classroom Management
    Center/station rotation activities
    Early finisher activities
    Behavior management systems
    Student goal tracking templates
    Reward systems and incentives
        These supplementary materials help teachers manage their classroom effectively while keeping students engaged.

I recommend we make Complete Unit Planners & Daily Lesson Plans our primary value proposition because:
It's the most universal need (every teacher needs lesson plans)
It's the most time-consuming task teachers face
It can be customized across grade levels and subjects
It naturally leads into the other categories (assessments, materials, etc.)
It's the foundation that teachers build everything else upon
By leading with comprehensive lesson planning, we can show teachers how all four categories work together as a complete system for their classroom. The $50 price point becomes extremely attractive when they see how much time they'll save across all these areas, especially compared to buying individual resources from other marketplaces.






#INITIAL PROMPT TEMPLATE
Familiarize yourself with @architecture.md , @plan.md , The website we are basing out project off, which is @logomakerr.ai , and our current UI which is in @src 

We will be making changes to our front end today. Specifically making our placeholder last wizard page. I think we broke up our wizard into multiple pages yesterday, and id like a placeholder page with our infamous "generate button". For now we will have a placeholder request. What questions do you have? Do not code anything yet.
